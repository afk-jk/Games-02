    <h1>How to Turn Your Class Notes Into Revision Gold</h1>
    <p>
      Most students take pages and pages of notes during the term… and then ignore them until the week before exams.
      At that point, it’s too late: everything looks messy and confusing, and you have no idea where to start.
      The trick is to quietly convert your notes into proper revision tools while the content is still fresh.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Clean up the chaos</h2>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Make your notes readable so you’re not fighting the mess later.
    </div>
    <p>
      Grab one topic at a time (for example, “linear equations” or “cells and organelles”). 
      Cross out random doodles, rewrite any lines you can’t read, and add headings so you can see where one idea ends and the next begins.
      You don’t have to rewrite the whole page — you’re just making it usable.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Build a one-page summary</h2>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Squeeze the topic into one clear page you can revise from.
    </div>
    <p>
      On a fresh page, try to fit the whole topic into:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>3–6 key headings</li>
      <li>Short bullet points instead of sentences</li>
      <li>One diagram or example for each heading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If it doesn’t fit, you probably wrote too much detail. 
      The summary is meant to be a map, not the entire textbook.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Turn the notes into flashcards</h2>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Make your brain practise remembering, not just re-reading.
    </div>
    <p>
      Use paper cards or an app. On one side, write a question; on the other, the answer. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Front:</strong> “What is the gradient formula?”<br>
          <strong>Back:</strong> “Change in y ÷ change in x, or rise over run.”</li>
      <li><strong>Front:</strong> “Function of mitochondria?”<br>
          <strong>Back:</strong> “Release energy for the cell through respiration.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you make these flashcards soon after the lesson, revision before tests becomes way easier because the hard work is already done.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Create your own practice questions</h2>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Test yourself in the same way the exam will.
    </div>
    <p>
      Look at your summary and ask: “If I were the teacher, how would I test this?” 
      Write 5–10 questions at the bottom of your notes or on a separate sheet. 
      Try to include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least one simple “define this term” question.</li>
      <li>A short explanation question (e.g. “Explain why…”).</li>
      <li>One or two multi-step problems or longer answers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Later, you can cover the answers and see how many you can do without looking.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5: Schedule tiny review sessions</h2>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Stop forgetting everything two weeks after the test.
    </div>
    <p>
      Instead of cramming, revisit your summaries and flashcards for just 5–10 minutes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>That evening</li>
      <li>A few days later</li>
      <li>At the end of the week</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These short reviews tell your brain, “Hey, this matters,” so the information sticks around much longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Turning class notes into revision gold isn’t about being naturally smart — it’s about having a system. 
      If you clean your notes, build summaries, make flashcards, and test yourself with your own questions, 
      exams stop feeling like a surprise and start feeling like a recap.
