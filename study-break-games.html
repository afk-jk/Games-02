    <h1>Quick Study Break Games You Can Play in Your Browser</h1>
    <p>
      Long study sessions without breaks are a disaster for your brain. 
      After around 30–40 minutes, your focus drops and you start rereading the same line over and over.
      Short, planned breaks can actually make you remember more — as long as you don’t disappear into a 
      two-hour gaming session.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use “smart” study breaks</h2>
    <p>
      A good rule is the <strong>25–5 pattern</strong>: study for about 25 minutes, then rest for 5. 
      During the break, your goal is to reset your brain, not totally switch it off. 
      That’s where quick, simple browser games can help. They’re fun, but they don’t drag you into a long storyline.
    </p>

    <h2>1. One-minute reflex games</h2>
    <div class="game-box">
      <strong>Good for:</strong> waking yourself up when you’re tired or zoning out.<br />
      <strong>Examples:</strong> reaction-time clickers, simple dodge-the-obstacle games, tap-to-jump runners.
    </div>
    <p>
      These games are perfect if you’ve just finished a tough maths question or a long paragraph of reading.
      Your brain gets a tiny burst of adrenaline, then you can jump back into work feeling more alert.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Simple puzzle games</h2>
    <div class="game-box">
      <strong>Good for:</strong> keeping your brain active without doing schoolwork.<br />
      <strong>Examples:</strong> matching shapes, sliding puzzles, quick logic challenges.
    </div>
    <p>
      Puzzles are helpful when you’re stuck on a question and need to reset how you’re thinking. 
      They still use logic and pattern-recognition, but there’s no pressure of marks or grades.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Memory mini-games</h2>
    <div class="game-box">
      <strong>Good for:</strong> training your short-term memory in a low-stress way.<br />
      <strong>Examples:</strong> card-matching, pattern recall, “remember the order” games.
    </div>
    <p>
      These games quietly build the same skills you use when you’re memorising formulas or quotes.
      If you like them, you can even create your own memory game using your school content —
      vocab words, definitions, or historical dates.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Set clear limits so you don’t fall down the rabbit hole</h2>
    <p>
      Even quick games can steal your whole afternoon if you’re not careful. 
      Before you start, decide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How long the break will be (e.g. exactly 5 minutes).</li>
      <li>How many rounds you’ll play (e.g. 3 levels, then stop).</li>
      <li>What you’re going back to when the break ends (e.g. “finish question 4 and 5”).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using a timer on your phone or computer makes it much easier to actually stop.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Match the game to the subject you’re studying</h2>
    <p>
      Different subjects drain your energy in different ways. If you’ve been:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Writing essays</strong> → choose something fast and visual to wake you up.</li>
      <li><strong>Doing hard maths</strong> → pick something silly and low-pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>Memorising content</strong> → try a short memory or matching game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal isn’t to become a pro gamer; it’s to recharge just enough so that the next study block feels possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Used properly, study break games can actually help you focus <em>more</em>, not less. 
      Keep them short, keep them simple, and always know what you’re going back to when the timer ends.
