    <h1>How to Study in Class Without Getting Bored</h1>
    <p>
      Almost everyone has sat in a lesson staring at the clock, wondering how it’s only been five minutes. 
      The problem usually isn’t that the topic is impossible — it’s that our brain has nothing to do except “listen.”
      If you give your brain a job, class stops feeling like one long drag and you actually remember what’s going on.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Turn yourself into a “note-taking machine”</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of copying every single word from the board, listen for the <strong>key ideas</strong>. 
      Try to write notes in your own words:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use short bullet points instead of full sentences.</li>
      <li>Underline or highlight definitions and formulas.</li>
      <li>Add small examples or doodles next to each idea.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you rewrite information instead of just copying, your brain has to process it. 
      That tiny bit of extra thinking is what moves things into your memory.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Ask “mini questions” in your head</h2>
    <p>
      While the teacher is explaining something, quietly ask yourself:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>“What is the point of this example?”</li>
      <li>“How could this show up on a test?”</li>
      <li>“What would happen if we changed one part of this problem?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You don’t have to say anything out loud, but this keeps your brain active instead of drifting.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use the margins of your book as a thinking space</h2>
    <p>
      The margins of your notebook are perfect for quick thoughts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a 💡 symbol next to anything that feels important.</li>
      <li>Put a ❓ next to anything you don’t fully get yet.</li>
      <li>Circle tricky examples so you can revisit them later at home.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Later, when you revise, all your most useful ideas are already marked.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Turn boring explanations into simple steps</h2>
    <p>
      A lot of class time is just the teacher working through steps on the board. 
      Instead of zoning out, rewrite the method in your notes like a recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write the equation.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move the constants to the other side.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Divide both sides by …</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you get home, you basically have a mini guide you created yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Use your teacher as a “live search engine”</h2>
    <p>
      If something is confusing, class is actually the easiest place to fix it. 
      You don’t have to ask a huge question. Try things like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Can you show one more example like that?”</li>
      <li>“What mistake do people usually make here?”</li>
      <li>“Is there a faster way to remember this?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      One quick question can save you a lot of stress later when you’re revising alone.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Connect the topic to your real life</h2>
    <p>
      Subjects feel pointless when they stay on the board. 
      During class, quietly look for one connection:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fractions → splitting a pizza with friends.</li>
      <li>Speed → how fast your bus actually moves.</li>
      <li>Cells → how your body heals a cut.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The more links you make, the easier it is to remember later — your brain likes things that feel useful.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Keep a simple “after-class” habit</h2>
    <p>
      When the lesson finishes, take one extra minute to star three key ideas in your notes. 
      That’s it. If you do this every lesson, you build a list of the most important points without 
      doing huge extra study.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t have to be the loudest student or the biggest nerd to get something out of class.
      If you keep your brain busy with small actions — questions, notes, and connections — the time passes faster
      and you walk out actually understanding what just happened.
